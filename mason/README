Welcome to MASON, a simulator designed for simple-multiagent simulations,
or to be used as a core library inside more sophisticated multiagent
simulators. 

MASON was written by Sean Luke, Gabriel Catalin Balan, and Liviu Panait. 
Additional code and apps were written by Daniel Kuebrich and Sean Paus. 
Much help was provided by Claudio Cioffi-Revilla and Ken De Jong.  MASON
is a joint effort of George Mason University's Evolutionary Computation
Laboratory (in the Computer Science Department), and GMU's Center for
Social Complexity. 

Here are files you should know about. 

LICENSE.  MASON largely uses the Academic Free License version 3.0.
	  Please read it first.  It is located in the LICENSE file.

INSTALLATION AND INTRODUCTION.  Installation information, and the root
          point for all documentation, can be found at docs/index.html . 

CHANGES.  The changes from previous versions are listed in the CHANGES file. 

If you have any questions, you have two routes.  First, check out the
MASON-INTEREST-L discussion group on the MASON website.  Second, the MASON
website also lists a help email address you can send mail to if you get
desperate.  The website URL is http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/
Please do NOT mail the developers directly.  Post to the discussion group. 

Note that most of the subdirectories contain README files describing the
classes and basic files in those directories.  This might or might not be
useful to you when poking around.

INSTALLATION AND RUNNING

To run 3D demos, you have to install Java3D.  To make movies, you have to
install the Java Media Framework (JMF).  To do charting, you have to install
JCommon, JFreeChart, and iText.  See the web page for information about
where to obtain and install these packages.  If the jcommon...jar, 
jfreechart...jar, itext...jar, and jmf.jar files (or other jar files) 
are not in your CLASSPATH, the scripts will still recognize them if you 
drop them in the 'mason' directory.

Quick start using the pre-made jar file.

1. Optionally install Java3D.

2. On the MASON web page (https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) there
   is a link to a zip file ("Libraries").  Inside that zip file are several
   jar files.  Add them all to your CLASSPATH.

3. In the 'jar' directory there is a file named something like
   'mason.jar'.  Try double-clicking on it (you may not be able to run
   all the 3D demos due to lack of memory).

4. Alternatively, you can run the mason.jar file, with expanded
   memory, like this:

   java -Xmx200M -jar jar/mason.jar sim.display.Console


Building from the Makefile

1. Optionally install Java3D.

2. On the MASON web page (https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) there
   is a link to a zip file ("Libraries").  Inside that zip file are several
   jar files.  Add them all to your CLASSPATH.

3. Build MASON from the Makefile.  I would do it like this:

	make jar

4. In the 'jar' directory there is a file named something like
   'mason.jar'.  Try double-clicking on it (you may not be able to run
   all the 3D demos due to lack of memory).

5. Alternatively, you can run the mason.jar file, with expanded
   memory, like this:

   java -Xmx200M -jar jar/mason.jar sim.display.Console

Where to go from here?:

1. Play with the demos.
2. Poke around in the docs.
3. Try tutorial 0 in the docs (just a tour of what MASON does)
4. Try tutorials 1-7 (which teach how to code MASON apps).  They're
   in sim/app.  
5. Read the how-tos for advanced questions.
6. If you get stuck, post to the discussion group.
7. There are various modules for MASON avaialble on the web page: check 'em out!
